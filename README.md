Usage Examples
Product Listing Page
Upon visiting the home page (http://localhost:3000), users will see a grid displaying the first 20 products. Each product card displays:

Product Image
Product Title
Price
Category
The pagination controls allow users to navigate to the next set of products. When a new page is loaded, the URL updates accordingly.

Product Detail Page
Clicking on any product will take the user to the product detail page (/products/[id]), where they will see:

A large image or gallery of images (if multiple images exist).
Product Title, Description, Price, and Category.
Product Tags, Stock Availability, and Rating.
Customer Reviews (including the reviewer's name, date, rating, and comment).
Error Handling
If the product list or detail data fails to load (e.g., due to network issues or an invalid product), a friendly error message will be displayed. This ensures the user is informed without breaking the experience.

Pagination
The pagination component allows users to navigate through multiple pages of products. The app fetches only the necessary product data for the current page and displays 20 products per page.

Error Handling & Loading States
Loading State: A loading spinner is displayed while the product data is being fetched.
Error Messages: If there is an error during data fetching, users will see a clear error message prompting them to retry or check back later.
Future Enhancements
Implement infinite scrolling for a smoother user experience.
Add product filtering options (by category, price range, etc.).
Enhance the user review section by allowing users to submit their own reviews.
Improve accessibility for users with disabilities by adding ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a well-rounded e-commerce product display application built using modern web technologies like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The focus on user experience, server-side rendering, and error handling ensures that users can browse and view products seamlessly, regardless of device or connection speed.
